### Travel Planner 

A website designed to provide user's with a choice of avaiable travel locations in an easy to use and new format.
It features a register button on the **Welcome Page** to allow users to bypass all information on the site instantly to sign up.
It also features a choice on the **Home Page** to allow users to choose either a sun holiday or snow holiday which is a search feature that will narrow the field based on the users interest.
By clicking either **Sun** or **Snow** the user can bypass any locations that are immediatley not of interest.
Upon choosing the climate of choice the user is presented with various locations to choose from in that given climate.
After choosing a destination, a page containing some useful travel information as well as a **Google map** showing locations of interest (Hotels, Food & Drinks and Attractions) is displayed.
The **Google maps** area will be interactive and allow a user to view the location of a recommended hotel, thing to do or food and drinks venue.

# Design

## Colour Scheme

The site features a few choice colors being :
- ![#e1eedd](https://via.placeholder.com/15/e1eedd/000000?text=+) **Light Grayish-Green** (#e1eedd),
- ![#2b6777](https://via.placeholder.com/15/2b6777/000000?text=+) **Strong Blue** (#2b6777), 
- ![#15b3bb](https://via.placeholder.com/15/15b3bb/000000?text=+) **Bright Cyan** (#15b3bb), 
- ![#1e4853](https://via.placeholder.com/15/1e4853/000000?text=+) **Dark Blue** (#1e4853), 
- ![#70776e](https://via.placeholder.com/15/70776e/000000?text=+) **Grayish Green** (#70776e),
- ![#ffffff](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ffffff/000000?text=+) **White** (#ffffff)
- ![#101010](https://via.placeholder.com/15/101010/000000?text=+) **Black** (#101010)

These colours were chosen to give a **bright, light and relaxed** feel to the website and to contrast well against pictures on the site.
The colours were also chosen because of the nature of the site and the fact alot of colours would be present from the destination images, colours who were somewhat "neutral" visually
were used to add good visual contrast and draw the users attention to the destinations.

## Fonts

- The site mainly uses the default font of **"sans-serif"** for easyness to read as there is not much styling to it, but **"Lobster"** was used in parts and it gave a sort of "fancy" feel to the destination pages, it has a fallback of **"sans-serif"**.
- The **"Akaya Telivigala"** font with a fallback of **"sans-serif"** was used to counteract the "fancy" feel and bring a youthful feel to the text such as on the greeting page.
- The combination of all fonts I feel incorporated both youthful and refined energies together thus appealing visually to a wider variety audience.

## Imagery

- The images used are all **travel related**. I thought it was important to have a consistant theme of visually striking images,
that were all close enough in subject matter and color to make a consistent feel across the site.The color of the images was important to have good crossover with the site **color scheme** and 
I believe the images chosen fit very well overall as they relate to the subject matter.
- Another important aspect was to pick images that no matter the content fit well together and provided impact against the background and while it was difficult to find 
both images and a site color theme that worked well together I feel I was successful in this regard without losing anything from either the image impact or color impact of the site.

### Wireframes

- The wireframes were created using **[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/?gclid=CjwKCAiA8Jf-BRB-EiwAWDtEGkJ6iKra1Rpbr_P_NWTlH_xSyg5fnl9cG87m1uVtg1HJKb3bCsG0BhoC3yMQAvD_BwE)** and were used as a rough guideline towards the finished product visualisation.

## User Stories Testing

 1. **As a new user I want to know the sites purpose immediately.**
  - The Home page has a greeting displaying and is displaying two images one of sun and one of snow to
  show the user what content is to be expected the name also suggests travel.
  - The register button is available immediately to allow the user to bypass not being able to book(this booking feature is not implemented yet.).
  - Upon clicking either of the images they will be redirected to obvious travel related pages with multiple choices of destinations.
  <img style="border:0;width:150px;height:100px" src="assets/images/userImages/user1.png" alt="User story!" />

 2. **As a new user I want an intuitive search experience**
  - Upon landing on the home page the user will see the first navigation option which is the choice between sun and snow.Upon choosing the will be redirected to another choice page
  this time containing cards the user can click to view more information about their chosen destination.This route of clicking images I found to be intuitive as there is little 
  to no reading involved as the images describe the location mostly allowing for a very relaxing search experience.
  - Navigation is done mainly by clicking images, cards or buttons as the destination and destinations pages are hidden from the navbar to encourage the user to use the 
  intended navigational route.
  - **Budget** filter buttons are found on the main **destinations** page to allow the user to show only locations that fit their **budget**.
  - Upon entering the page the user will notice the **top located Navbar**. On mobile this is displayed as a hamburger icon and on desktop it will be a standard navbar layout. Upon clicking any of these
  navbar links the user will be redirected to the corresponding page.
  - The **navbar** sticks to the screen responsively allowing the user to navigate to other pages at any time.
  - The **buttons** on the pages are highlighted in different colours to stand out from the background allowing the user to find them easily and are all linked either
  to internal pages or external pages.
  - All information is labelled and contrasted to allow even users who have difficulty reading to see all text and content clearly.
  - All links like **gov.ie** and the additonal information are highlighted in blue for easy recognition.
<img style="border:0;width:150px;height:100px" src="assets/images/userImages/user3.png" alt="User story!" />

 3. **As a new user I expect to be able to navigate the site easily to find a holiday.**
  - As mentioned above in **User Story 2** the search experience is designed to be very simple for all ages.
  - The **cards** and **images** are clearly labelled with destination **names** and provide additonal infromation when clicked.
  - **Budget** filter buttons are found on the main **destinations** page to allow the user to show only locations that fit their **budget**.
  <img style="border:0;width:150px;height:100px" src="assets/images/userImages/user2.png" alt="User story!" />

 4. **As a new user I expect to be able to sign up to services.**
  - **Register now** button located on the **homepage** for ability to sign up to services immediately this is also located on the main **destinations** page.
  <img style="border:0;width:150px;height:100px" src="assets/images/userImages/user1.png" alt="User story!" />

 5. **As a new user I expect to be able to contact the business to ask question prior to signing up.**
  - The **contact page** is labelled in the navigation menu and easy to find.
  - Upon clicking on contact tab the user will find a simple 3 step form with the ability to ask a question but **no requirement** to sign up.
  <img style="border:0;width:150px;height:100px" src="assets/images/userImages/user5.png" alt="User story!" />

 6. **As a new user I expect to be able to find additional information to help my decision.**
  - Additional information is included on each of the destination pages showing **Average Cost of day, Average Cost of transport, Average Cost of Meals** and **Local Language** to aid the user in deciding.
  - **Budget** filter buttons are found on the main **destinations** page to allow the user to show only locations that fit their **budget**.
  <img style="border:0;width:150px;height:100px" src="assets/images/userImages/user8.png" alt="User story!" />

 7. **As a potential customer I want an easy sign up process.**
  - The site contains **multiple forms** but none of them have a process more than 4 steps which would be easy for young and old users alike to sign up.
  - The sign up form is contained in the **modal** and is accessed with the **register now** button.
  <img style="border:0;width:150px;height:100px" src="assets/images/userImages/user6.png" alt="User story!" />

 8. **As a potential customer I want reassurance that the service is indeed worth it.**
  - The site contains price indications both on the **destinations** page in the form of **€** signs with a legend and also on the destination page once one has been chosen where it lists common costs.
  - These features are not present in most travel sites and from **usability** testing done seems to have a positive impact as it is so simple and really conveys the ideal **cost** for each user.
  - The sites **simplicity** in navigation and a **stress free** environment to browse destinations also add value to this with no bold advertisements or constant links to other websites most
  information is contained within the site.

 9. **As a potential customer I want to be able to easily know how much this service will cost me.**
  - The sites sign up is free and there is no charge displayed on the site(although average costs of destinations are shown).
  - It's value is maintained from that as the main revenue will come from **advertising** and sharing with 3rd parties but for the **user**
  it presents as a free to use travel organiser with ease of use(costs will come in the form of booking fees in future).

 10. **As a returning user I want news and other useful content to entice me to return.**
  - Useful information is contained on the **Destination page** with valuable information to any holiday maker or traveller.
  - Due to the layout/construction of the site this information can be updated and expanded upon very easily.

 11. **As a returning user I want to be able to have access to follow the company on social media.**
  - The site contains **social media icons** to redirect the user to each platform, they are located in the footer and are consistent on every page of the site.

 12. **As a user I expect to be able to search locations and information about where I'm staying..**
  - The **user** can search the site using the intended navigation system.
  - The site contains **Google maps** and is fully interactive.
  - The **user** has the ability to filter the desired info on the map.
  - The **user** can see a **table** of very relevant information above the map and all destinations are clear and easy to navigate.

## Usability 

- I shared the website with friends and family and received feedback from them stating the site was eay to use,
all features implemented fuctioned as expected and there were no issues brought ot me attention.
They also mentioned that its simplicity lead to easy usage and navigation and the text and color choices made everything very user friendly.
Additional comments were that the page highlighted the destinations well and that the navigation was different than usual and lead to a very calm browsing experience.

## Issues and Fixes during Development

1.Images for main choice were not functioning correctly when clicked.
 - Attempted fixes = Non viable solutions tried were wrapping the div in a link or anchor tag which did not work.
 - Solution = created JS function to redirect user upon click event to corresponding page.

2.New card not styled correctly.
 - Solution was to add extra card id to styles in css.

3.Buttons background color change when clicked reverting back to original after mouse is unclicked.
 - Solution was to add a focus style class to keep the color on the currently cliked button.

4.Issue getting divs to display properly when button was clicked to corresponding budget/luxury.
 - Many solutions were tried but none gave desired effect, most kept hiding or showing the wrong divs for the button selection.
 - After using toggle a few times while trying to solve the issue I read that toggle can take true and false values so I syncronised each div to 
 true or false depending which button was clicked and it worked with desired effect.

5.Issue with greeting to user not displaying, tried to use innerHTML and appendChild to fix.
 - Solved by creating a new element with variable as the original was a string and not a node that could be appended, also the class was not targeted the ID was targeted instead to be more specific to where I wanted it appended.

6.Issue with mouse events not displaying opcity on sunCard and snowCard.
 - This was caused because I declared the function after it was being used and because a function was not declared as the 2nd parameter.
 - Solution was to move the declaration above the working code to ensure it was declared before use and i also added arrow functions as the 2nd parameters to ensure the mouseEvent was working as a function.

7.Issue with display of user welcome after email.js added to index page.
 - Problem was that js was in head tags and was loading before the html.
 - Solution was to add "defer" to the script tags to ensure they loaded last after the html.(while this resolved the issue it also made the code browser dependant)

**Most of these previous issues have been made redundant and no longer apply due to reformatting the site(please check commit history if interested)**

**Main Issue** - The main issue I was tasked with was providing a site that was easy to use and implemented as much reasonable JavaScript/ jQuery as possible.
My first plan was to store all of my **array** in **local storage** but when it came to extracting data the issue I came across was the destination page had not loaded for me to be able to target what was shown and where.
Because of this the only option I would have had was to use **Asynchronous JavaScript** which I am not familiar with. So I switched to using **URL parameters** to perform the function and was met with great success. Implementing **URLS** I was able to filter my information and display it when required and **store my pages** in the **URL** for all the sites choices.
The site was quiet complex in all the pages relationships to each other so I opted for creating seperate files for specific pages like destination.js was for the destination page only.
All of the sites intended functions and navigation works as intended and overall I am very happy with it and the JS knowledge I was able to implement, no doubt there are still things to change in future but 
at present the site functions exactly as it is supposed to.
