A website designed to provide user's with a choice of avaiable travel locations in an easy to use and new format.
It features a register button on the **Welcome Page** to allow users to bypass all information on the site instantly to sign up.
It also features a choice on the **Home Page** to allow users to choose either a sun holiday or snow holiday which is a search feature that will narrow the field based on the users interest.
By clicking either **Sun** or **Snow** the user can bypass any locations that are immediatley not of interest.
Upon choosing the climate of choice the user is presented with various locations to choose from in that given climate.
