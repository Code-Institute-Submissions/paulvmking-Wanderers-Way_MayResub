### Travel Planner 

A website designed to provide user's with a choice of avaiable travel locations in an easy to use and new format.
It features a register button on the **Welcome Page** to allow users to bypass all information on the site instantly to sign up.
It also features a choice on the **Home Page** to allow users to choose either a sun holiday or snow holiday which is a search feature that will narrow the field based on the users interest.
By clicking either **Sun** or **Snow** the user can bypass any locations that are immediatley not of interest.
Upon choosing the climate of choice the user is presented with various locations to choose from in that given climate.
After choosing a destination, a page containing some useful travel information as well as a **Google map** showing locations of interest (Hotels, Food & Drinks and Attractions) is displayed.
The **Google maps** area will be interactive and allow a user to view the location of a recommended hotel, thing to do or food and drinks venue.

# Design

## Colour Scheme

The site features a few choice colors being :
- ![#e1eedd](https://via.placeholder.com/15/e1eedd/000000?text=+) **Light Grayish-Green** (#e1eedd),
- ![#2b6777](https://via.placeholder.com/15/2b6777/000000?text=+) **Strong Blue** (#2b6777), 
- ![#15b3bb](https://via.placeholder.com/15/15b3bb/000000?text=+) **Bright Cyan** (#15b3bb), 
- ![#1e4853](https://via.placeholder.com/15/1e4853/000000?text=+) **Dark Blue** (#1e4853), 
- ![#70776e](https://via.placeholder.com/15/70776e/000000?text=+) **Grayish Green** (#70776e),
- ![#ffffff](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ffffff/000000?text=+) **White** (#ffffff)
- ![#101010](https://via.placeholder.com/15/101010/000000?text=+) **Black** (#101010)

These colours were chosen to give a **bright, light and relaxed** feel to the website and to contrast well against pictures on the site.
The colours were also chosen because of the nature of the site and the fact alot of colours would be present from the destination images, colours who were somewhat "neutral" visually
were used to add good visual contrast and draw the users attention to the destinations.

## Fonts

- The site mainly uses the default font of **"sans-serif"** for easyness to read as there is not much styling to it, but **"Lobster"** was used in parts and it gave a sort of "fancy" feel to the destination pages, it has a fallback of **"sans-serif"**.
- The **"Akaya Telivigala"** font with a fallback of **"sans-serif"** was used to counteract the "fancy" feel and bring a youthful feel to the text such as on the greeting page.
- The combination of all fonts I feel incorporated both youthful and refined energies together thus appealing visually to a wider variety audience.

## Imagery

- The images used are all **travel related**. I thought it was important to have a consistant theme of visually striking images,
that were all close enough in subject matter and color to make a consistent feel across the site.The color of the images was important to have good crossover with the site **color scheme** and 
I believe the images chosen fit very well overall as they relate to the subject matter.
- Another important aspect was to pick images that no matter the content fit well together and provided impact against the background and while it was difficult to find 
both images and a site color theme that worked well together I feel I was successful in this regard without losing anything from either the image impact or color impact of the site.

### Wireframes

- The wireframes were created using **[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/?gclid=CjwKCAiA8Jf-BRB-EiwAWDtEGkJ6iKra1Rpbr_P_NWTlH_xSyg5fnl9cG87m1uVtg1HJKb3bCsG0BhoC3yMQAvD_BwE)** and were used as a rough guideline towards the finished product visualisation.

## Issues and Fixes during Development

1.Images for main choice were not functioning correctly when clicked.
 - Attempted fixes = Non viable solutions tried were wrapping the div in a link or anchor tag which did not work.
 - Solution = created JS function to redirect user upon click event to corresponding page.

2.New card not styled correctly.
 - Solution was to add extra card id to styles in css.

3.Buttons background color change when clicked reverting back to original after mouse is unclicked.
 - Solution was to add a focus style class to keep the color on the currently cliked button.

4.Issue getting divs to display properly when button was clicked to corresponding budget/luxury.
 - Many solutions were tried but none gave desired effect, most kept hiding or showing the wrong divs for the button selection.
 - After using toggle a few times while trying to solve the issue I read that toggle can take true and false values so I syncronised each div to 
 true or false depending which button was clicked and it worked with desired effect.

5.Issue with greeting to user not displaying, tried to use innerHTML and appendChild to fix.
 - Solved by creating a new element with variable as the original was a string and not a node that could be appended, also the class was not targeted the ID was targeted instead to be more specific to where I wanted it appended.

6.Issue with mouse events not displaying opcity on sunCard and snowCard.
 - This was caused because I declared the function after it was being used and because a function was not declared as the 2nd parameter.
 - Solution was to move the declaration above the working code to ensure it was declared before use and i also added arrow functions as the 2nd parameters to ensure the mouseEvent was working as a function.

7.Issue with display of user welcome after email.js added to index page.
 - Problem was that js was in head tags and was loading before the html.
 - Solution was to add "defer" to the script tags to ensure they loaded last after the html.(while this resolved the issue it also made the code browser dependant)
