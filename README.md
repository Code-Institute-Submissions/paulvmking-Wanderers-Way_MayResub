### Travel Planner 

A website designed to provide user's with a choice of avaiable travel locations in an easy to use and new format.
It features a register button on the **Welcome Page** to allow users to bypass all information on the site instantly to sign up.
It also features a choice on the **Home Page** to allow users to choose either a sun holiday or snow holiday which is a search feature that will narrow the field based on the users interest.
By clicking either **Sun** or **Snow** the user can bypass any locations that are immediatley not of interest.
Upon choosing the climate of choice the user is presented with various locations to choose from in that given climate.
After choosing a destination, a page containing some useful travel information as well as a **Google map** showing locations of interest (Hotels, Food & Drinks and Attractions) is displayed.
The **Google maps** area will be interactive and allow a user to click on the locator pins and view more information about the hotel,attraction etc..

## Issues and Fixes during Development

1.Images for main choice were not functioning correctly when clicked.
 - Attempted fixes = Non viable solutions tried were wrapping the div in a link or anchor tag which did not work.
 - Solution = created JS function to redirect user upon click event to corresponding page.

2.New card not styled correctly.
 - Solution was to add extra card id to styles in css.

3.Buttons background color change when clicked reverting back to original after mouse is unclicked.
 - Solution was to add a focus style class to keep the color on the currently cliked button.

4.Issue getting divs to display properly when button was clicked to corresponding budget/luxury.
 - Many solutions were tried but none gave desired effect, most kept hiding or showing the wrong divs for the button selection.
 - After using toggle a few times while trying to solve the issue I read that toggle can take true and false values so I syncronised each div to 
 true or false depending which button was clicked and it worked with desired effect.

5.Issue with greeting to user not displaying, tried to use innerHTML and appendChild to fix.
 - Solved by creating a new element with variable as the original was a string and not a node that could be appended, also the class was not targeted the ID was targeted instead to be more specific to where I wanted it appended.
